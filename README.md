This app is built over SwiftUI using MVVM design pattern. 
The app has been built sticking to SOLID desing principles by ensuring Model, View, and ViewModels taking the respective responsibilities. 
Ideally the networking api calls could have been segregated in a seperate networking layer but has been ignored for this small application.
